# Toms-Weather-Dashboard

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

When you search for a CITY, a display of 5 forecasted days show on the webpage. It features descriptive items regarding temp, humidy, wind-speed and more! 

Your searches are saved, until you hit the Clear History Button.

I used 3 Javascript, HTML and CSS to create this Weather Dashboard. 

It meets the requirements below: 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
